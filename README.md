## :key: Secure Password Generation Tool

PassGen is Electron password "encryption" tool, which hashes the user input, into a SHA-256 Hash.


## :clipboard: How it works:

1. User inputs a weak password or phrase.
2. PassGen hashes the input with SHA-256.
3. The hash is automatically stored to user's clipboard.
